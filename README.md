### Open Deep Learning Course: dlcourse.ai (from ODS.ai)

![Course Banner](https://dlcourse.ai/assets/images/img_banner.jpg)

The course is designed to deal with modern deep learning from scratch and does not require knowledge of neural networks or machine learning in general. Lectures by streams on Youtube, tasks in Python, discussions and help in the best Russian-speaking ML-communities - [ODS.ai](http://ods.ai/) and [ClosedCircles](http://closedcircles.com/?invite=a5f6bea89716a16054cfbfb3fafa6ed111dff4b8).

At the same time and in the same volume, the course is read for master students of **Novosibirsk State University**, as well as students of the CS center of Novosibirsk.
